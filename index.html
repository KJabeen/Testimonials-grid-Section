                         code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
                        theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had
                        to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                        could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                        example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                        full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
